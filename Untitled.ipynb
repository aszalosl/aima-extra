    "Four people go to a river at night. There is a narrow bridge, which can only hold two people at a time. They have one torch and since it's dark, the torch must to be used when crossing the bridge. Person A can cross the bridge in one minute, B in two minutes, C in five minutes, and D in 10 minutes. When two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person's pace. The question is, can they all get across the bridge in 17 minutes or less?"
